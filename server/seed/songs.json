I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you.  I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  While my guitar gently weeps Look at you all? Still my guitar gently weeps",
